// What we do - Section
Headline: Our mission
Rising to the top of the food chain comes with a lot of responsibility. Right now, mankind struggles to take care of them.
United Earth fights for giving nature's wild life a voice humans can understand. Right now we litter, we exploit, we enslave other living beings. This needs to stop.
Our teams spread awareness, protect animals's rights in front of the law, clean up and invent new sustainable technologies for a better future.
We not only care about humans respecting nature, we also believe in respecting each other. Let's start treating each other that way.
Together we can make a change - from the individual to multi-million-dollar-companies.
We can't influence nature's natuarl cycle, but we can nurish it as best we can.

01: Battlefield: Amazon Forest
The burning down of the Amazon Rainforest costs many unique plant and animal species the life - some of them are the last of their kind. But what can you do if politics, games of power and money rule over a biotop's destiny?

02: New home for our caucasian friends
We have good news! Our animal shelter in Georgia's caucasian mountains is now home to 300+ lost and hurt animals. Wild dogs, bears, and even horses are being taken care of by our workers and the local community.

03: Sea Farming
Industries now are planning on disrupting the ocean's ground in search for resources. This will not only destroy the untouched life in the deep sea but also affect millions of water-species's hearing and orientation - leading to more stranded animals.

04: Green Roofs
Major cities like New York, Tokio and London now invest into rooftop parks and bee sanctuaries. This will create space for wild flowers and a full diversity of insects to flourish right in the center of our world's most hectic metropols.

Battles we've won
(with icons)
01: 649 sanctuaries built across the globe. From whales to tigers, we protect and help hundreds of species in our shelters until they're ready to live in their wild homes again.
02: 410 elephants rescued in India and Africa. They've been brutally hunted for their tusks or robbed of their natural habitat. We treat them and fight for their rights.
03: 38.7 million tons plastic removed from the seas. Waste destroyes the ocean's wild life and puts animals like turtles and dolphins in danger. Our teams actively clean the waters and work on innovative solutions.
